CSE 687 Object Oriented Design


Project Phase 1 - Map Reduce WorkFlow:
	The Map_Reduce Project is a standalone command-line program written in Visual Studio using the C++ Language.
The command-line program runs a word count MapReduce workflow. This program runs as a single process, with no threads or multiple processes.
	The MapReduceNativeTest is a Native Test Project that tests the Map_Reduce command line program.



Project Phase 2 - Map Reduce WorkFlow with DLL
	Update 5/9/23: This project has been updated to take in a Map DLL and Reduce DLL from the user rather than using the source code's cpp and h files
